        Start a stub service with the given pact file(s). Pact URIs may be local file paths or HTTP.
        Include any basic auth details in the URL using the format https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@URI.
        Where multiple matching interactions are found, the interactions will be sorted by
        response status, and the first one will be returned. This may lead to some non-deterministic
        behaviour. If you are having problems with this, please raise it on the pact-dev google group,
        and we can discuss some potential enhancements.
        Note that only versions 1 and 2 of the pact specification are currently fully supported.
        Pacts using the v3 format may be used, however, any matching features added in v4 will
        currently be ignored.
